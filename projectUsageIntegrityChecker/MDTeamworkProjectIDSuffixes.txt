# Each non-blank line is a suffix for an MD teamwork project ID.
# If a local module has an ID ending in one of these suffixes, this local module will be considered invalid.
#
# This matches the suffix of the "SysML Extensions.mdzip" profile that used to be on Teamwork.
# According to CAE, the teamwork profile has been deleted so we can turn off
# the local teamwork project ID for this suffix.
